        <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
        <h4>Spokenvote is a tool to help groups of any size, from a local school board to an entire nation’s people, reach consensus with radical efficiency. We think the process should be intuitive, fun, and yes, democratic.</h4>
        <h4>Deeply inspired by Wikipedia, Spokenvote is an open source non-profit intended for small groups today, but over time to reach national politics. It starts with spontaneously capturing ideas as they occur to us. When we do that as a diverse group, a <i> “power of the crowd” </i> effect is introduced. The result is often a revelation of common sense that is difficult to discover from a top-down approach.</h4>
