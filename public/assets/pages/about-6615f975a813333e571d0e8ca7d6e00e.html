  <h2>Consensus Simplified</h2>

    <ol class='attention_red'>
      <li>Find a group</li>
      <li>See what they're proposing</li>
      <li>Help the best ideas reach consensus</li>

  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <div class='content_div'>
    First we capture your ideas, called Proposals. Then you get to organically improve the semantics of those proposals on your way toward reaching a majority opinion together. As the wording improves, the best proposals gain momentum by receiving support from multiple users and forming a clarity of consensus.

  <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
  <div class='content_div'></div>
  Spokenvote is a tool to help groups of any size, from a local school board to an entire nation’s people, reach consensus with radical efficiency. We think the process should be intuitive, fun, and yes, democratic.
  <div class='content_div_half'></div>
  Deeply inspired by Wikipedia, Spokenvote is an open source non-profit intended for small groups today, but over time to reach national politics. It starts with spontaneously capturing ideas as they occur to us. When we do   that as a diverse group, a
  <em>“power of the crowd”</em>
  effect is introduced. The result is often a revelation of common sense that is difficult to discover from a top-down approach.
